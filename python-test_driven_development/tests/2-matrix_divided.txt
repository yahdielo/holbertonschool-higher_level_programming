The ``matrix_divided`` doctest
=============================
This module divides every element of the matrix with a given number and stores the resut 
in a list of lists wiwh is ``matrix_divided``:


>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
matrix must be a matrix (list of list) of integers/floats

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix,)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
div must be a nuumber

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
Each row of the matrix must have the same size

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7,"hello"]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
matrix must be a matrix (list of list) of integers/floats

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
division by zero

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, "hello")
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
div must be a number

>>> matrix = [[1, 2 ,3 ,4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]
